Racing Line
===========

Racing Line is a simple plugin for Assetto Corsa, it traces the racing line of
the current lap and best lap so you can compare trajectories, etc.

Future plans include exports of the data point for further analysis, possibly
through a web interface.

For now simply download the [latest zip](https://github.com/mathiasuk/racingline/archive/master.zip) and unzip it in:

*Your steam folder*\steamapps\common\assettocorsa\apps\python

You will also need to rename the **racingline-master** folder to **racingline**
for the plugin to be recognised by Assetto Corsa
